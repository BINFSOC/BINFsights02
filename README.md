# the mother of bioinformatics

IT IS TEMPTING TO BELIEVE THAT THE PRINCIPLES, METHODS, AND TOOLS USED 
FOR COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY THAT WE TAKE FOR GRANTED ARE AS MODERN 
AS THE COMPUTERS THAT WE USE THEM ON.  BUT THEIR ORIGIN CAN BE TRACED 
BACK TO ONE PARTICULAR WOMAN WHO PIONEERED BIOINFORMATICS.

# Women in BINF: Margaret Dayhoff 
> 1925 - 1983

<p>
#ChooseToChallenge  this  year  reminds  us  
that we can choose to seek out and celebrate 
the  achievements  of  women.  In  1965,  the  
very first database for protein sequences was 
compiled and printed by American physical 
chemist Dr. Margaret Oakley Dayhoff.  Fast 
forward  half  a  century  and  you  are  very  
likely  to  find  databases  based  on  her  work  
being used day-to-day by both 
bioinformaticians and scientists alike. </p>

<p>
Dayhoff, arguably the pioneer of the 
bioinformatics field, was responsible for 
interlacing biochemistry with the rapid advances  in  computing  present  during  the  
Cold War.  In doing so, she paved the way for 
new methods and technologies to be 
developed in order to tackle tough biological 
puzzles -- methods that have evolved into the 
modern bioinformatics tools that we are 
familiar with today.
  </p>
  
 <p>
  
  Born in Philadelphia in 1925, Dayhoff 
gained  an  education  in  mathematics  while  
attending the Washington Square College in 
New  York,  and  after  three  years  of  study,  
would  go  on  to  also  pursue  a  doctorate  in  
quantum chemistry at Columbia University.
  This would place her at the very forefront of 
computing  at  the  time,  particularly  IBM’s  
Watson Scientific Computer Laboratory.  The 
Watson  Lab  played  an  important  role  in  the  
development of aerospace defence 
technology, and would later be involved with 
nuclear missile systems and used by NASA in 
the Apollo missions.
  </p>
  
<p>
  Driven  by  an  interest  in  using  computers  to  
improve the speed and accuracy of the 
scientific  calculations  in  her  work,  Dayhoff  
began  an  uphill  journey  to  lay  the  seeds  for  
the tools and techniques that we all recognise 
today in bioinformatics.  In her position at the 
National  Biomedical  Research  Foundation,  
Dayhoff addressed the problem of comparing 
and piecing together small peptide sequences 
to form a complete protein.  Using IBM’s new 7090 data processing machine, six times more 
powerful than previous models, she 
developed the first protein sequence 
alignment program named 
“COMPROTEIN”,  which  she  published  in  
1962.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  
  Dayhoff also created the one-letter code used 
to  describe  amino  acids  as  they  appear  in  
protein sequences.  In the era of punch-cards 
and bulky vacuum-tube computers, the 
hardware used for piecing together these 
protein sequences was limited, and any 
opportunity to increase efficiency  was 
valuable.  In an effort to reduce file size out of 
necessity,  Dayhoff  developed  the  one-letter  
code  to  which  biochemists  still  refer  to  this  
very day.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  It is important to note that digital computing 
and statistics have not always been 
appreciated  in  biology.  Dayhoff’s  work  with  
her colleague, Robert Ledley, at the National 
Biomedical Research Foundation challenged 
many scientific “purists” to speak out against 
the move to incorporate new computer-basedCome  along  and  answer  all  your  burning  questions  
about  where  your  degree  can  take  you  whilst  gaining  
insightful advice from industry leaders.
Note:  no  experience  studying  bioinformatics  required,  
everyone is welcome.

being  an  outsider  to  the  challenging  culture  
surrounding her, Dayhoff continued her push 
to  show  the  true  potential  of  computerised  
models in answering questions within the life 
sciences. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Her  next  step  was  compiling  a  list  of  all  
known  protein  sequences  at  the  time,  and  
documenting  their  variations  across  species.   
This work would be published in her “Atlas of 
Protein  Sequence  and  Structure”  in  1965.   
Later editions were moved to magnetic tape, 
and  the  legacy  she  started  would  continue  
through  projects  including  the  Protein  Data  
Bank and GenBank.  Notably, the 
reconstruction of phylogenetic trees to 
describe evolutionary history was made 
possible through her method of comutational 
sequence comparison.

  <p>
  Dayhoff’s approach to computing and 
biology has allowed the expansion of biomedical research to where it is today.  Her 
contributions to bioinformatics are humbling, 
and are responsible for giving us the tools and 
methods  to  continue  asking  computational  
questions  to  answer  biological  questions  --  
from the proteins in our blood, peptide 
sequences  in  our  atmosphere,  and  the  origin  
of life itself.
